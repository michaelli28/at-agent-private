# What the checker covers, and what was cut

## Retired: Section2Evaluator (decided 2026-09-19)

`evaluation/src/operable/Section2Evaluator.ts` sits untracked in the root checkout and was never committed on any branch. It is not ported, and the root file is left untouched.

- **Its 2.1.2 check** flags five Tab presses whose observation text doesn't change. That is the identical-text collision that the Tab walk (backendNodeId identity) and F4 remove. It is also limited to one-element cycles, and it reads the old agent's trace format.
- **Its other checks** (2.4.1 bypass, 2.4.2 page title, 2.4.4 link purpose, 2.4.5 multiple ways, 2.4.6 headings/labels) are static checks outside the keyboard claim.
  - axe-core already runs `bypass`, `document-title`, `link-name`, `label` and `empty-heading` alongside the checker.
  - 2.4.5 has no axe equivalent and is not covered.

## Retired: the 2.4.3 focus-order rule (decided 2026-09-19)

`DynamicEvaluator.checkFocusOrder` flagged a page when a focus identity repeated inside a four-event window. On a real page that is wrap-around, which every page does (bench/probes/wrap/RESULT.md). It is deleted rather than repaired: WCAG 2.4.3 is about whether the focus ORDER preserves meaning, which a repetition test over a keypress sequence cannot decide. Nothing replaces it.

- **Recall lost — one page.** The pre-fix baseline scores 2.4.3 detection `1/1 · 1.00 [0.21, 1.00]` on a single page (bench/results/cd3b122/REPORT-baseline.md:41), identified by bench/SPOTCHECK.md:113-116 as BAD's `before/survey`, SC 2.4.3 on `#page #ev`, technique F85, reader A only. After the cut that row reads `0/1`. The row stays in the report; it is not deleted.
- **What that recall cost.** The same rule scored `7/7 · 1.00 [0.65, 1.00]` false alarms on clean pages (bench/results/cd3b122/REPORT-baseline.md:52) — seven false positives for one true one.
- **No substitute.** axe contributed `0/1` on 2.4.3 in the baseline (bench/results/cd3b122/REPORT-baseline.md:41). Whether axe-core ships any 2.4.3 rule at all is unverified.
- **The dead `checkFocusIndicator` config flag went with the class.** It was never read. WCAG 2.4.7 has a Tab-walk-driven check in `packages/accessibility/src/focus-indicator.ts`, but nothing calls it yet: not the agent, the CLI or this harness (see below).

## What the 2.1.2 and 3.2.1 verdicts do not establish (decided 2026-09-19)

- **A backward-armed trap is not covered.** A page is judged from one forward Tab walk; no second walk in either direction is judged (the gap detector's own walk, bench/run.ts:96, feeds no judge). A handler that traps only on reverse entry is invisible.
- **A trap needing two Escape presses reads as inescapable.** The probe presses Escape exactly once, in `runEscapeProbe` (packages/accessibility/src/tab-walk.ts).
- **Shift+Tab is never independent evidence.** Escape is pressed before the probe key, so only the conjunction "Escape failed AND the opposite key failed" is meaningful.
- **F55 ships with no recorded dev fixture.** `focusLostOnArrival` is false on all 8 dev bases (bench/corpus/dev/labels.json) and on all 27 variants recorded at cd3b122, because no operator in bench/corpus/dev/operators.ts produced it when they were seeded. The M7 blur-on-focus operator was added at 4d7356a so the rule has dev-corpus evidence, but the variants recorded at cd3b122 predate it: until a fresh dev-variant run is recorded, the focus-removed rule is proven on synthetic and inline fixtures plus the M7 variant, not on any recorded baseline walk.
- **A same-document SPA route change is not seen.** The URL rule needs `location.href` to change.
- **One observation, one criterion.** An F55 failure also fails 2.1.1 and 2.4.7; those stay with the gap detector and the focus-indicator check, so 3.2.1 recall is not counted three times.
- **A context change that arrives after the 150 ms settle is refused, not reported** — a timer cannot be told from a focus handler. Those presses are listed as `url-changed-after-settle`. Since round 2 a focus drop first seen at the settled read is refused the same way, as `focus-removed-after-settle` (see the round-2 section).
- **An `undetermined` verdict counts as a miss.** It stays in both denominators and is printed as its own count beside the rate, so the before/after comparison stays like-for-like. A judge that refuses to decide must not be able to buy detection by shrinking the denominator it is scored on. The asymmetry is stated rather than hidden: on a clean page a refusal scores exactly like a correct pass, so the false-alarm cell also prints the worst case (the rate if every refusal had been a false alarm) and drops the rule-of-three bound, which assumes every page was observed.

## What the fix design saw of the held-out set (decided 2026-09-20)

The fixes were designed from the dev corpus and the probes. The places where held-out knowledge
nonetheless touched a decision, stated here rather than left for a reader to find:

- **The F55 rule was chosen knowing how the BAD pages fail.** `packages/accessibility/src/context-change.ts`
  says so in its header: focus removed on arrival is how all four W3C Before-and-After pages fail
  3.2.1. No BAD page was opened to design the rule and no BAD output was read, but the rule was
  prioritised because that failure mode was known to be the one that matters. This is the most
  attackable fact in the project and it is deliberately not buried.
- **The 2.4.3 deletion was decided with held-out numbers in hand.** The retirement above cites BAD's
  `before/survey` and the pre-fix baseline's 1/1 detection and 7/7 false alarms. Those numbers come
  from the test set. The rule's deletion was mandated independently (repetition is 2.1.2's job and a
  keypress-sequence test cannot decide focus ORDER), but the decision is test-informed and is
  labelled as such.
- **M7 was added to the dev corpus after the labels were frozen** (commit 4d7356a), specifically so
  the F55 rule would not execute for the first time on the test set. It was added before the fix it
  supports was measured, it changes no test-set page, and it is labelled 3.2.1 only. Disclosed in
  the same spirit as the two committed sampling-rule amendments.
- **M8-M13 and five dev bases were added after the labels froze** (round 2, 2026-09-23): operators
  M8-M13, the bases `disclosure-tabs`, `native-dialog`, `one-button`, `scroll-panel` and
  `remount-on-keydown`, and a portal on `react-div-button`. Each was built to show one round-2 checker
  fix, so the old → new dev deltas they produce hold by construction and are not independent evidence
  that the fixes work. They change no test-set page. The spot-check stays pinned to the Checkpoint-1
  corpus (`CHECKPOINT1_CORPUS` in `bench/spotcheck.ts`): its 20 recorded answers stand, and none of
  them covers this material.

## What the harness does NOT measure (decided 2026-09-20)

- **The F7 focus-indicator check is not in the harness.** `bench/run.ts` imports no focus-indicator
  module, so the 2.4.7 row scores only the gap detector's `not_focusable` mapping. No shipped path
  runs `focus-indicator.ts` either (the agent's `checkKeyboard` and `at-agent gaps` do not call it), so
  that check has no number anywhere in this report.
- **One forward walk per page.** A trap armed only on reverse entry is not covered.
- **No aggregate precision is computed.** The report scores per criterion. Any single headline
  X → Y must name which criteria it aggregates and must state that 2.4.3 contributes a before 7/7
  → after 0/7 false-alarm change that comes from DELETING a rule, not from fixing one.
- **A page whose Tab walk did not assess `not_focusable` is not scored for 2.1.1 or 2.4.7.** That
  gap type is the only one carrying those criteria and the detector emits it only after an assessed
  walk, so such a page counts as `undetermined` in BOTH columns — never flagged: a miss on detection, a clean-looking pass on a false-alarm count — and drops
  the rule-of-three bound there. `summary.json` records the reason per page
  (`tools.gaps.findings.keyboard`) and the report prints it beside the page's gap count. Before this
  was recorded, a check that could not run was indistinguishable from one that found nothing; that
  is how the harness shipped `not_focusable 0/7` with the walk structurally disabled (fixed 118bb99).
- **The pre-fix summaries at cd3b122 predate this schema.** `SummarySchema` is now version 3
  (`WalkStats.trap` became a judge verdict in v2; the gaps run gained its keyboard evidence in v3),
  so those files fail to parse on version rather than silently mis-parsing. Re-render them at their
  own commit; they are a frozen artifact. The same now applies to the v2 dev runs at e1eb294 and
  118bb99.

## Round-2 fixes: what they cover and cost (decided 2026-09-23)

The labelling calls the round-2 dev material needed, and the two Run A cross-product cells no design predicted
(the old checker at 0a71e4e, `bench/results/0a71e4e/dev-variants`). What each fix covers and costs is added
with the fix. Run B, the new checker on the same dev pages at 145b3da (`bench/results/145b3da/`), shows the
same dev changes as the bullets below; `bench/REPORT.md` §10 has the Run A → Run B table.

- **M10, a script loop from the last stop the script counts to the first, is labelled a 2.1.2 trap.** Once
  focus is in the loop, Tab and Shift+Tab never take it out. WCAG 2.1.2 is worded per component, and
  where the loop holds several components focus can leave each of them. The label schema's
  "Tab/Shift+Tab alone cannot move focus out of some region" takes the loop as the region, so the M10
  variants carry `keyboardTrap: true, trapEscapable: false`. Read per component, all but one would be
  clean: on `one-button__M10__only-button` the loop is the page's one button, which Tab and Shift+Tab
  never leave, a per-component trap like M5. The loop holds every stop whose `tabIndex` is 0 or more; on
  eight M10 pages that is every Tab stop Chromium reaches from load. On `scroll-panel__M10__agree-button`
  it is not: the two keyboard-focusable scrollers after `agree-button` report `tabIndex` -1 and sit
  outside the loop, so Shift+Tab from a fresh load reaches one and the next Tab leaves the page. On
  `navbar__M10__offcanvas-open` a person who opens the account menu with Enter can Tab past the loop's
  end and out of the page. Both labels stand, because focus in the loop never leaves it by Tab or
  Shift+Tab alone.
- **M11's copy is made with `cloneNode`, which drops listeners added with `addEventListener`.** On
  `js-handlers`, `one-button` and `scroll-panel` the target therefore stops working after the first Tab
  press on it: Enter on the copy does nothing. The label stays `keyboardAccessible: true`, because the
  schema's rule is reachable and operable from a fresh page load, and from a fresh load Tab reaches the
  original, which Enter operates.
- **2.1.2: a complete stop count ends the page only after a recent wrap** (acc-walk#1's residuals).
  Reaching as many distinct stops as F in the last F+1 presses now also needs a wrap within the last
  2·max(F, L)+1 presses, L being the longest lap the walk measured. Without one, the release probe
  decides, so a trap on the page's only stop (`one-button__M5`), a loop over every stop (M10, labelled a
  trap above) and a loop padded with scrollers (M12) now fail. A trap armed too late to leave that many
  trapped presses before the walk ends still passes.
- **2.1.2: a walk's release read through node identity is refused when
  its last F+1 presses reach more stops than F**, as `undetermined / focusables-exceeded`. F then misses
  stops or the page re-creates nodes, so reaching an "unseen" element proves nothing. A wrap or a
  replaced document still releases, and a probe that gets nowhere still fails.
- **2.1.2: a stop re-rendered on every press (M11) is refused, not failed.** Each press lands on a new
  node, which the walk cannot tell from moving on; failing it needs an identity beyond the DOM node, which
  the rebuild removed on purpose. It counts as a miss. A trap where only some stops re-render can still
  pass, and so can a trap whose Escape handler re-creates the focused stop: the new node reads as Escape
  releasing it (`pass [escape-key]`).
- **2.1.2: scrollers are Tab stops F does not count.** Chromium stops on a scrollable box with no
  focusable child, and counting one would re-implement that rule in page JS. F does count every editing
  host (bare `contenteditable`, `true` or `plaintext-only` in any case), and the gap detector's walk
  shares that count. F also misses image-map areas, which Chromium stops on: the selector's `a[href]`
  does not match `area[href]`, and round 2 did not add it. A link and 14 areas (F = 1) is refused, where
  13 pass (the cost below; measured, not pinned). No dev page has an image map.
- **2.1.2: what the recent-wrap rule and the refusal cost on clean pages** (synthetic pages walked in
  chrome-headless-shell 143). A page with F ≥ 1 loses `all-stops-visited` when no wrap falls in its
  walk's last 2·max(F, L)+1 presses, and the release probe decides. If a Shift+Tab reaches a wrap, or a
  stop outside the last F+1 presses, the page passes, unless it was a stop and those presses reached
  more stops than F: then it is refused (`focusables-exceeded`). If all F+2 Shift+Tabs stay on those
  presses' stops, as inside a stop that takes several presses, it fails (next bullet), whether the walk
  ended inside that stop or just after it. 12 scrollers then a datetime-local passes
  (`pass [opposite-key]`): the walk ends on the input's third field, so the third Shift+Tab gets out.
  With one-press stops and focus starting at the top, the 5(F+1)+5-press walk misses the wrap exactly
  when the page has 4F+10 or more stops F does not count, and the page is refused (pinned in
  `keyboard-trap.test.ts`). Autofocus breaks that bound: a button, 17 scrollers and an autofocused last
  button (F = 2, so 4F+10 = 18) wrap on the first press only and are refused. Several-press stops need
  fewer: one datetime-local then 8 scrollers (F = 1, 7 + 8 = 15 presses) is refused, where 7 scrollers
  pass. Only the 4F+10 bound is pinned. A page where F is 0 (only scrollers, say) is refused unless its
  walk ends on its first stop or on a wrap.
- **2.1.2: stops that take several Tab presses give wrong verdicts both ways.** Tab steps through the
  fields of a date or time input, and through the controls of `<audio controls>`, on one element
  (chrome-headless-shell 143: datetime-local 7 presses, date and time 4, month 3, audio with a silent
  clip 5), and the walk and its probe count presses as if every stop took one. A clean page with two
  datetime-local inputs fails, and a dialog loop over a date input and a button, a trap, passes. The
  recent-wrap rule adds false fails on clean pages whose walk never wraps and whose probe stays inside
  such a stop: 8 to 11 scrollers then a datetime-local (the walk ends inside it); 7 scrollers, a
  datetime-local and one more scroller, or with F = 2 a link, 10 scrollers, a datetime-local and 2 more
  (the walk ends just after it); and a link and 10 scrollers then `<audio controls>`. `it.fails` pins
  five (`tab-walk.test.ts`): the two-datetime page, the date loop, 8 scrollers then a datetime-local,
  7 scrollers with one after the input, and the audio page. No dev page has a date, time or media input,
  so no dev number measures this.
- **`native-dialog` is labelled clean.** Its age gate is a `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()` on
  load. The page behind it is inert until Confirm closes the dialog and is then reachable with Tab, so
  the background controls are labelled accessible with no gap. Tab from Confirm leaves the page for the
  browser's own UI, so the page is no trap (`keyboardTrap: false`). Its script is a file, so no operator
  is seeded on it.
- **`remount-on-keydown` is labelled clean.** It re-renders `<main>` on its first keydown, so the gap
  detector's crawl and its Tab walk see different nodes: a hazard for the checker, not a WCAG defect,
  because every control still works from the keyboard. Its script is a file, so no operator is seeded
  on it; an operator's script would bind to nodes the first keydown removes.
- **3.2.1: the settle fix refuses a focus drop first seen at the settled read.** The walk reads focus
  about 1 ms after each Tab press and again after the 150 ms settle. A drop that shows only at the second
  read is listed as `focus-removed-after-settle`, not reported, as a late URL change already was: a page
  timer cannot be told from a focus handler there. The refusal covers any focus removal first seen after
  the first read, whatever deferred it: a timer of 1 ms or more, a CSS animation, or chained
  `requestAnimationFrame` calls. Measured on real `chrome-headless-shell` walks of small local pages (5
  walks, 30 drops each): `setTimeout(blur, 1)`, a blur two `requestAnimationFrame` calls later, and a 60 ms
  CSS animation to `visibility: hidden` with no script were each refused on 30 of 30 drops. A removal
  made in the focus handler (`blur()`) or in the next task or frame (`setTimeout(blur, 0)`, one
  `requestAnimationFrame`) already shows at the first read and is still reported, 30 of 30 each. The
  design's walks found the same for `display: none`, `inert`, `disabled` and removing the element.
  The cost is planted as M8, whose target blurs 60 ms after focus: re-judging Run A's recorded walks, all 9
  M8 variants go from `fail` to `pass`. That is the fix's price, not an improvement.
- **3.2.1: the settle fix still leaks on a timer that drops focus with no URL change.** A tick that lands
  in the ~1 ms between a press and its first read is still reported. A small local page whose timer
  replaced a button every 100 ms (about 30 drops a walk) was walked 10 times in `chrome-headless-shell`
  when the fix was designed: 2 walks still failed, against 10 of 10 before. The mixed-timing refusal that
  would close this was declined.
- **3.2.1: the idle fix stops a fragment-only change voiding the walk.** Before the first press the walk
  watches the idle page, and a URL change there voids the walk as
  `undetermined / page-navigates-without-input`. A change to the `#fragment` alone no longer does, as every
  other URL comparison in the judge already ignores it, except on a walk that also has a
  `focus-removed-after-settle` refusal: a timer setting `location.hash` clears focus by itself, so that
  walk stays `undetermined`. Re-judged, 8 of the 9 M9 variants go from `undetermined` to `fail` with the
  same findings. `one-button__M9__only-button` goes to `pass`: the walk never sets `focusLost` there, the
  same miss as `one-button__M7__only-button` below, which the void was hiding.
- **3.2.1, M8: focus held for tens of milliseconds counts as reached by the gap detector.** It takes an
  element as reached when either read after a Tab press found focus on it (`gaps/keyboard.ts`). An M8
  target holds focus for 60 ms, so a person cannot operate it and it is labelled `not_focusable`, but the
  detector reports no gap: 9 known misses, pinned in `bench/gaps-dev.test.ts`.
- **`one-button__M7__only-button` reads 3.2.1 `pass`, an old-checker miss.** The walk marks a drop
  `focusLost` only after focus has been on a real element in the document (`lastRealSeen`, `tab-walk.ts`).
  The page's only stop blurs on arrival, so every read is `body` and all 8 drops are filed
  `no-preceding-stop`; the gap detector does flag it `not_focusable`. B1's settle fix also needs `focusLost`,
  so the cell stays `pass`.
- **`scroll-panel__M6__agree-button` reads 2.1.2 `undetermined / document-replaced`; the other 8 M6 pages
  pass.** The walk counts 3 stops (not the two scrollers), so the judge wants a wrap in the last 4 presses,
  and a lap here is 6. M6's reload at press 3 puts the wraps at 9, 15 and 21, none in 22-25, and a replaced
  document turns off the all-stops-visited signal. A refusal on a page labelled no trap, not a wrong verdict.
- **gaps: content the page switched off is no candidate once Chromium leaves it unexposed.** Chromium leaves
  out of the accessibility tree anything under the `inert` attribute or CSS `interactivity: inert`, and
  everything outside an open modal `<dialog>`; the detector flagged each such control
  `missing_from_a11y_tree` (critical). It now reads all three from the DOM and drops a disabled or inert
  candidate Chromium does not expose, aria-hidden or not. A disabled control Chromium exposes is still judged.
  The cost: a real defect behind a modal open at load goes unjudged, as one in an aria-hidden page behind a
  modal already did after a walk. The page behind a modal `<dialog>` in a shadow root keeps
  `missing_from_a11y_tree` (pinned in `gaps/detect.test.ts`). With two modals stacked, the page behind both is
  dropped, but the controls inside the lower modal keep `missing_from_a11y_tree` (run on a probe page, not
  pinned). An `aria-modal` element changes no flag (run on a probe page); by the design's probes it removes
  nothing from Chromium 143's tree. A mouse-only control that is only aria-hidden stays critical: Chromium
  prunes every aria-hidden element that cannot take focus, so trusting its aria-hidden reason instead would
  have silenced 12 of 12 such controls on the design's probe.
- **gaps: a React root or portal container no longer owns React's delegated listeners.** React 17+ marks each
  container it delegates events from with `_reactListening<random>` and listens there, so an empty portal host
  was flagged `wrong_role`. A marked element's CDP listeners no longer count as its own; an inline `onclick` or
  a React activation prop still does. A container that is also a real control through its own
  `addEventListener` loses that signal. React 16 sets no marker, and Svelte 5 and Solid delegate without one,
  so they are unchanged (from the design's reading of their source, not run).
- **gaps: a `<details>` is a group, not a control missing its name.** Its `<summary>` is the named control. A
  `<details>` with its own click listener keeps `wrong_role`.
- **gaps: a roving tablist whose container has no box keeps its arrow-key evidence.** A zero-area or
  `display: contents` container's keydown handler credits its own members, never an outer widget around it.
  Arrow keys handled on the document are still not seen, so such members stay `not_focusable`.
- **gaps: on the dev pages the four fixes change exactly 21 of 107 gap cells.** Measured by the live
  `bench/gaps-dev.test.ts` run over every dev page, before and after, in `chrome-headless-shell`: all 10 M13
  targets lose their false `missing_from_a11y_tree`; `native-dialog` goes from 2 flags to 0;
  `react-div-button` loses `wrong_role@portal-host` and keeps `wrong_role@add-to-cart-div`; `disclosure-tabs`
  and its 9 variants lose all 4 of the page's own alarms (2 on the M5, M6, M10 and M11 variants, whose walks
  do not assess `not_focusable`). The other 86 pages are unchanged, the M8 and `form__M9` `not_focusable`
  misses included. These pages were built to show the fixes, so this shows the fixes run, not how much they
  help.
- **gaps timing: a Tab walk counts only if it ran on the nodes the crawl listed.** The detector flags a crawled
  control the walk never reached `not_focusable` (critical). A page reloaded before or during the walk (its idle
  baseline included), re-mounted in the same window, or rewritten with `document.open()` left the walk reaching
  only new nodes, so every crawled control was flagged on a page with no defect. The detector now marks the
  window before the crawl and checks after the walk: a lost mark gives `document-replaced`, and a crawled node the
  walk never reached that has left the document gives `crawled-nodes-detached`. The nodes checked include those
  read as `no-box`, because a node removed before its box is read has none: without them, a re-mount right after
  the crawl left no candidate to check, and a real `not_focusable` was lost with the page scored as an assessed
  pass (CONFIRMED by two tests in `detect-timing.test.ts`: a re-mount just before the box read, and one just
  after the tree read). Either way `not_focusable` is not assessed, so the page's 2.1.1 and 2.4.7 cells are
  undetermined, and the page stays in both columns. Nothing is read before the walk. A navigation that lands
  while the mark is written destroys the write's context: the error is caught, and the new window, which has no
  mark, is refused as `document-replaced` after the walk (CONFIRMED by a test page that reloads from inside the
  write, and on pages that reload themselves around the end of the 3 s settle or carry a 3 s meta refresh: the
  write threw in 8 of 39 runs before, in none of 105 after). A page closed during the walk keeps its
  `walk-error`. What still throws: a page closed while the mark is written, as any read of a closed page did
  before, or while the post-walk check runs, which now throws
  (`Target page, context or browser has been closed`) where it used to return a result, so `bench/run.ts`
  records no gap result for it; and a navigation that lands during the title read after the tree read
  (`Execution context was destroyed`), as before these fixes (1 of those 105 runs; 3 of 31 self-reload runs at
  `6ee3b83`). On the probe (`bench/probes/gap-timing/RESULT.md`) the reload, idle-baseline and
  `document.open()` rows go from 4 × `not_focusable` to no gap.
- **gaps timing: the accessibility tree is read after the DOM crawl.** Every candidate now existed when the tree was
  read, so content the page adds while the detector reads is no longer flagged `missing_from_a11y_tree`
  (critical): on the probe's timer page, 20 to 23 flags in 5 of 5 runs before, none in 5 of 5 after. A page
  replaced or re-mounted right after the tree read gives no gap, because its crawled nodes are gone before their
  boxes are read; with a walk it is refused (`document-replaced`, or `crawled-nodes-detached` for a re-mount in
  the same window). Without a walk nothing says the page changed, but `bench/run.ts` and the CLI always walk.
- **gaps timing: a refused walk falls back to the no-walk result, and that can add flags.** Only a walk shows that
  an aria-hidden control is hidden from the keyboard too; without one the static rule flags it
  `hidden_but_interactive` (moderate). The rule is kept on refused walks (decided 2026-09-23). Pinned in
  `packages/accessibility/src/gaps/detect-timing.test.ts`: a modal page replaced before the walk gains 2 such flags
  on its correct aria-hidden background, and a modal page whose background drops a toast on the third keydown,
  with no replacement at all, gains 3. A zero-area Tab stop the walk never holds can also gain a flag (the probe's
  zero-area row: `wrong_role`, serious). The refusal fires whenever the page's own script removes a crawled node
  the walk never reached, shown or not (a `no-box` one counts too), such as a toast, a carousel re-rendering its
  slides or a React re-key: that page's 2.1.1 and 2.4.7 go undetermined, and a real `not_focusable` on it is
  missed. Withholding aria-hidden flags on a refused walk was declined: real M3-type flags would then read as
  clean, and 4.1.2 has no undetermined path in the bench.
- **gaps timing: what the check cannot see (ASSUMED: reasoned from the code, not measured).** An attribute-only
  change during the walk (`aria-hidden` toggled, `tabindex` removed on focus) keeps the node, so nothing is
  refused and the crawl's reads stay those of crawl time. A node the walk reached and the page then replaced is not
  refused: the reach was real. A crawled node detached and re-attached before the check reads as connected. A node
  detached exactly at the tree read and re-attached before its box is read still reads as missing from the tree. A
  replacement after the walk's last press, before the check, refuses a walk that was sound. The check costs one
  script call before the crawl, one after the walk, and one CDP read per unreached crawled node, `no-box` ones
  included, until the first detached one: 96 to 103 ms for 350 on the probe.
- **gaps timing: on the dev pages the two fixes change the gap result of exactly 1 of 107 pages.** Measured by
  running every dev page through the detector as `bench/gaps-dev.test.ts` does, before the fixes and after each
  of them, in `chrome-headless-shell`:
  `remount-on-keydown`, which re-renders `<main>` on its first keydown, goes from `not_focusable` on `home-link`
  and `about-link` to no gap, with `not_focusable` not assessed (`crawled-nodes-detached`), so its 2.1.1 and 2.4.7
  cells become undetermined on a page labelled clean. The other 106 pages are unchanged in gap list, assessment
  and reasons, the earlier gap fixes' cells included. The page was built to show this hazard, so this shows the
  fix runs, not how much it helps.

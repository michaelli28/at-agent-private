# Probe: live-site reachability (Day 1)

Run 2026-09-18, worktree `bench/detector-eval` @ 6b2f270. Landing URLs only: no accessibility checker, gap detector or axe ran, and nothing was clicked.

## Answer

- **Old dev sites you can use:** mealkeyway, fake-university, cmu and troy-k12 work in both headless modes. amazon is **degraded**: the first load returns a 202 challenge, and one time out of 4 in new-headless it showed a "Continue shopping" bot page instead of the store. troyroyalpalace is **dead**: 404 with Squarespace's "Website Expired" page.
- **BAD:** you can download all of it over plain HTTP (curl and Playwright's request API both get 200 and real pages). Loading it in any headless Chromium hits a Cloudflare check ("Just a moment...", 403) in both modes, and changing the user agent doesn't help. So download it and serve it locally. The official `bad.zip` has every page and report.
- **Headless shell vs new headless:** for sites that load normally or are fully blocked, the verdicts matched. For amazon, only new headless got the bot page, and only 1 time in 4.

## Verdict rules

- **usable**: 2xx response, the real page shows in the screenshot, and there's no real bot wall.
- **degraded**: the real page loads, but something makes repeat runs unreliable: an occasional bot page, a non-200 challenge status, or networkidle that sometimes never settles.
- **blocked**: the real page never shows in the browser, because of a bot wall or a dead site.

`bot-wall (heuristic)` means the task's regex matched the title or body text. `adjudicated` means I checked the screenshot and the matched text.

## 1. Curl from inside the sandbox (`allowed_domains` = that host)

The two 403s came from the sandbox proxy, not the sites. fake-university.com and cmu.edu redirect to `www.`, so the sandbox needs both hosts in `allowed_domains`.

## 2. Playwright outside the sandbox (`probe.mjs`)

Modes (confirmed in `followup-run.txt`):

- `shell` = `chromium.launch()`, which runs `chromium_headless_shell-1200/.../chrome-headless-shell` (Chromium 143.0.7499.4). User agent: `HeadlessChrome/143.0.7499.4`.
- `newheadless` = `chromium.launch({channel:'chromium'})`, which runs `chromium-1200/.../Google Chrome for Testing` (143.0.7499.4). User agent: `HeadlessChrome/143.0.0.0`.

Settings: `goto` waits for `domcontentloaded` (same as `packages/browser/src/page.ts:12`), then networkidle with a 30s timeout. Each URL gets a fresh context, 4 at a time per mode.

The Playwright run covered the index, 4 before pages, 4 after pages and 4 before-reports (13 URLs). The 4 after-reports were only checked with curl (all 200).

## 3. Follow-up (`followup.mjs`)

- **Amazon, 3 more loads per mode, one after another:** shell 3/3 `status:202` and the real store (focusable 329/309/308, networkidle reached). newheadless 3/3 `status:202` and the real store (focusable 328/315/306), but networkidle **timed out on 2 of 3**. Across all runs: shell got the real store 4/4, newheadless 3/4. New headless got the "Continue shopping" page once. Main status is 202 every time except that one bot-page load.
- **w3.org, plain HTTP vs browser:** Playwright's request API (no JavaScript) got `200`, title `Before and After Demonstration: Overview` (9301 bytes) for the index and `200` `Welcome to CityLights! [Inaccessible Home Page]` (24068 bytes) for before/home, `server: cloudflare`. Both browser modes still get `403 "Just a moment..."`, with the default user agent and with a normal desktop Chrome one (no "Headless" in it). Cloudflare is blocking the headless browser itself, not the user-agent string.
- **`bad.zip`** (`https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/bad.zip`): curl got `200 … 590387 application/zip`, 141 files. It contains all 8 pages and all 8 reports (`before|after/{home,news,tickets,survey}.html`, `before|after/reports/*.html`), dated 2012-02-20. Zip `before/home.html` compared with the live copy: 49 changed lines, all cosmetic (trailing spaces, `http://`→`https://` in the W3C header links). I only compared `before/home.html`. That the other pages match too is ASSUMED.

## BAD URLs (for the vendor fetch script)

Found from the BAD index links (`./before/*.html`, `./after/*.html`) and from the "Report" links on each before page (`./reports/<p>.html`, `../after/reports/<p>.html`).

## Notes for the harness

- The task's bot-wall regex had one miss (the Amazon "Click the button below to continue shopping" page) and one false alarm (`robot` matches "Robotics" on cmu.edu). Consider adding `continue shopping` and changing `robot` to `\brobot\b` or `are you a robot`. I haven't made that change.
- On amazon, don't gate on networkidle. It timed out on 2 of 3 new-headless follow-up loads.

## Verifier corrections (2026-09-18, workflow wf_25f6c5c5-8c4)

The verifier reviewed all 40 screenshots and agreed with every usable / degraded / dead / blocked verdict. It re-ran each blocked or degraded site once in the shell, and every verdict was stable. Corrections:

- **Amazon doesn't always start with a 202.** One new-headless load was a direct 200 serving the "continue shopping" bot page. The 202 (CloudFront) → 200 two-navigation sequence is now CONFIRMED by the verifier (0.6s apart); this probe had only inferred it.
- **Amazon at domcontentloaded:** `BrowserPage.goto` uses `waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'` (packages/browser/src/page.ts:12). At that point Amazon's title is "" (the 202 placeholder). A harness has to wait for the second navigation.
- **networkidle on Amazon also timed out in the shell** (20s budget), so don't gate on networkidle in any mode.
- **BAD is blocked on all 17 URLs in the shell,** including the 4 after-reports (307 → 403, `cf-mitigated: challenge`). New headless was verified on 13 of the 17.
- **troy-k12:** 631 vs 613 focusable is two modes, not two loads. It also has a floating overlay panel over the hero.
